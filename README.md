# Personal Portfolio

This is a simple static website, made from scratch, showcasing my web projects. It's currently a work in progress but if you'd like to see it live, you can find the [demo here](https://zhagm.github.io/Portfolio/)!

## Installation

If, for some reason, you'd like to run this project locally, you can simply

```
git clone https://github.com/zhagm/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
```

and open up index.html in your browser, perhaps using the following command:

```
open ./index.html -a Google\ Chrome
```

Voila! The portfolio page should be open in your browser now.
You can modify, customize, mess it up all you want now, enjoy!
